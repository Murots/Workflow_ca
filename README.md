# Workflow_ca

In this task we are assigned to create a good workflow enviroment, adding formatting- and issues hooks and also automatic testing by Jest and Cypress.

### Installing

1. Clone the following repository:

```bash
https://github.com/Murots/Workflow_ca/tree/workflow
```

### Running

-Run npm build (to compile SASS to CSS)
-Run npm start (to run locally) 
-Run npm test (to run Jest and Cypress tests)

## Changes/problems

This was maybe the hardest course for me so far. A lot felt very alien at first, but I'm very satisfied that I'm now starting to see the whole picture. I hope to show acceptable understanding in the end.
